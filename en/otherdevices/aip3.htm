		<h1>iPod (3rd&nbsp;gen.)</h1>
		<p>
			The first iPod with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_connector#30-pin_dock_connector">30-pin port, known as the "dock connector"</a>.<br>
			This model represents an almost complete abandonment of the 1st and 2nd generation design, opting for a rounded front panel, dropping the FireWire port, a redesigned remote control slot for playback control and, most importantly, a new way to navigate. Buttons such as menu and play/pause, which were previously on the edge around the scroll wheel (and later in ClickWheel) are arranged in a single line above the scroll wheel. All control is completely touch-based, which seems modern and easier, but in practice, more often than not, makes it more difficult to use the player. Accidentally selecting an option is quite easy, making the hold switch a remarkably good friend. If it weren't for the fact that the buttons are in their respective recesses, using them sightlessly would be impossible, and unexpected touches would be even more frustrating.
		</p>
		<p>
			As mentioned earlier, important is the introduction of a new 30-pin connector, which was present on all Apple mobile devices until 2012. Here it supports both FireWire and USB connections, with charging only via the first protocol. Therefore, this model requires a separate charger and cable, which are currently difficult to find. And charging is, unfortunately, quite frequent. The third-generation iPod can "boast" the shortest battery life of the entire series of classic models.
		</p>
		<p>
			This unit has a 16 GB CompactFlash card in place of the factory 10 GB 1.8" hard drive. This replacement was not so easy, as this generation of iPod is known for being picky about adapters and memory cards. In my case, a Pretec brand CF card worked, while a Transcend caused the iPod to randomly freeze, stop responding to input, or have system errors like the battery indicator disappearing. Overall, it is not a very friendly device.
