			Hello! I'm Matlaw.<br>
			Crazy, a little older than Windows Me, IT guy who loves electronics (and often breaks something). Lover of older technology, fanatic of anything he likes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Can I say something more about myself?<br>
			Well, I am a student and I'm trying to find my place in this world. From a very young age I've been interested in electronics and computers of all kinds.
			In the magical land of computer science I rather deal with hardware, because as I discovered, programming is not my cup of tea.<br>
			As you can see in the lists of <a href="pclap.htm">computers</a>, <a href="phones.htm">phones</a> and <a href="othdevices.htm">other devices</a>, I've managed to collect some junk over the years.
			Inspired by many creators to which links can be found
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MatlawtheGeek">on my YouTube channel</a>, I thought I'd try it too.<br>
			Why not share it on the Internet? After all, it is also some form of preserving history.

		<p class="smalltitle">Questions and answers</p>
		<ul>
			<!--<li>
				<p>
					<b>Why is your nickname <i>Matlaw</i>?</b><br>
					This is a little strange story. In 2012, I had a Samsung Galaxy Ace and I was playing with custom ROMs created by a man with a nickname <i>Mac≈Çaw</i> (Maclaw Studio).
					Later I set up an account on XDA-Developers and because of lack of an idea I just replaced "Mac" from Maciek (a Polish name) with a particle of my name and got rid of the Polish letter. Really.<br>
					That's how it stayed and I still use this nick. All in all, I even got a little tied up with the name.
				</p>
			</li>-->

					<b>Why the old junk?</b><br>
					For me, discovering what existed long before I was born or when I was still too young is extremely fascinating.
					It is, in fact, discovering something completely new, different, but in the past.
					I can also compare it with the world of today and admire the technological progress, given its history.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>What are your hobbies?</b><br>
					As I mentioned, it is mainly electronics. I'm trying small repairs, a little tinkering and recently I'm discovering the art of drawing (on a graphic tablet) and playing on a synthesizer.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>What is this page about? Why is it so simple?</b><br>
					Well, I really liked <a href="https://piteusz.ovh/index_en.php">Piteusz Website</a>. I didn't expect such a simple website to look not so bad and be very functional.
					I decided to do something similar and use it as a somewhat biased "digital museum" and maybe even more in the future.<br>
					The site is intended to be lightweight, load very quickly, not consume unnecessary resources and be able to display on everything,
					which has some form of an HTTPS-enabled web browser and access to the Internet.<br>
					Go ahead, you can use <a href="https://rn10950.github.io/RetroZillaWeb/">RetroZilla</a> on Windows&nbsp;98.
				</p>
			</li>

					<b>What is this profile picture?</b><br>
					I had no idea about my identity on the Internet, and I don't like to leave a void. Previously, for years I used the floppy disk found in the logo, but eventually I decided it was better to have separate symbols for the site and for myself as a person.<br>
					The visible character is an anthropomorphic lynx I designed, with a pale blue coat. I like cats, and lynxes are quite interesting, though not so popular animals, and I quite like their being a "bigger house cat with funny tufts".<br>
					Anthropomorphism is about "humanizing" a thing. In the case of animals, if you are familiar with characters like Bugs Bunny, Yogi Bear or Chip and Dale, you already know what I mean.

					This is just a kind of unfunny joke on my part, meant to parody the <i>all rights reserved</i> phrase.<br>
