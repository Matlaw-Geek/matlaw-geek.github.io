		<h1>Nokia 3510</h1>
		<p>
			The successor to the <a href="nmp3410.htm">Nokia 3410</a>.<br>
			A model that finally abandons the continuous use of the motherboard and frame from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">3310</a>, unlike the aforementioned 3410, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3330">3330</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5510">5510</a>. Although the battery pack remained the same.<br>
			A quickly forgotten cell phone by the release of a more desirable, <a href="nmp3510i.htm">slightly revised variant with a color display</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Nokia 3510 was the first Nokia phone to support polyphonic ringtones. This functionality was thanks to Beatnik miniBAE audio engine, and it was the 3510 that was the first mobile device to use this technology. This alone has already won the hearts of customers, as it was a demonstration of a completely new technology compared to the well-known and then ubiquitous beeping monophonic ringtones.<br>
			This further developed the market for custom ringtones, which could be purchased with a rather expensive SMS. Most often these were MIDI-made snippets of popular songs of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Getting back to the device itself, the version with a monochrome screen (3510) and a color screen (3510i) can be distinguished even without booting up the phone. The 3510 has white stripes on the sides of the case and a greenish switch button, while these elements on the 3510i are orange. In addition, the model without the “i” was available in other color variants, although nothing prevents you from swapping front and back covers between models. The unit seen in the photos just has one with the 3510i.<br>
			Technically, these phones do not differ (aside from the boot screen, built-in games and ringtones), and the motherboards look to be twinned. However, the version with a color display at times takes a moment to load menu items and boots a bit longer.
		</p>
		<p>
			This model has a unique (earache-inducing) startup sound that, unlike the model with an “i” at the end, is not synthesized:
		</p>
		<p>
			<audio controls>
			<source src="../../snd/kolekcje/NMP3510_start.wav" type="audio/wav">
			[An audio player should be here. If something does not work, the file is available <a href="../../snd/kolekcje/NMP3510_start.wav">here</a>]
			</audio>
		<p>
			The sound was recorded from the audio output of a unit without operator branding. Normally it is played through the ringer speaker. And yes, this sound does indeed sound so bad.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			This unit comes from the Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Polska#Mobile_network">Idea</a> network and had a SIM lock.
