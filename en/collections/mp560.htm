		<h1>Mio P560 DigiWalker</h1>
		<p>
			A representative of an almost extinct species of devices - palmtops.<br>
			A device bought for GPS navigation, although it could do much more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Palmtops, called "PDA" (personal digital assistant) or "handheld PC", were supposed to be... well, handheld PCs.
			When smartphones usually did not have a touch screen, PDAs allowed for a larger display, focusing on productivity.<br>
			Touch screen is a classic of devices from before the time of the absolute domination of the iPhone, i.e. resistive, which was used with a dedicated stylus. 
			Of course, nothing prevented you from using your finger, finger nail, pen, toothpick, nail, pendrive or other palmtop.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system used is Windows Mobile, based on Windows CE. The history of Microsoft's mobile systems is a bit complicated, but it is important to note that 
			the successor of Windows Mobile 6 is Windows Phone 7 - the last CE-based mobile Windows.<br>
			Windows Phone 8 under the hood, is a completely different system, because it is based on Windows NT. Windows 10 Mobile is a further development of Windows Phone 8 
			technology and has nothing to do with Windows Mobile 6. It's obvious, isn't it?
		</p>
		<p>
			Going back to Windows Mobile 6, this system, unlike the later released, was very popular. The availability of the application was high, and you can still find a 
			lot of programs and games created by independent developers on the Internet.<br>
			Heck! On such an unobtrusive palmtop you can install the official port of "Age of Empires" called "Pocket PC Gold Edition" and enjoy the full game, which is 
			surprisingly comfortable to play, despite the hardware limitations.
