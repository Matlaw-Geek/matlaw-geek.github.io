		<h1>Nokia 230 Dual SIM</h1>
		<p>
			One of many contemporary primitive cell phones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nokia in 2013 decided to gradually phase out its S30 and S40 platforms by changing the chipsets in phones to the typical MediaTek rubbish. This also involved the adoption of the Nucleus system, which Nokia tried to stylize on the one known from the brand's classic phones. It's just a shame that even the older S30 was richer in features, more intuitive and refined. Really, it's better to get yourself a used model from 2004-2012 than to buy today's keypad "Nokias", as the new models are 10 steps backward in quality, technology and function.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Nokia 230 is just one of those sad mobile phones, although developed and released after the acquisition of Nokia's mobile division by Microsoft. It's hard to say what the authors had in mind when creating this phone.<br>Of course, Microsoft, as Microsoft does, crammed its (now defunct for years) MSN and Bing services into the system, adding to questions about the thought process in designing the device.
		</p>
		<p>
			This model has the most budget parameters, supporting only 2G (how would online services like Bing work with that?), but Microsoft wanted to make it "premium" for its segment. Hence the plastic of slightly higher quality than other devices with the Nokia logo, an aluminum back cover and... two cameras and two flashes? Yes, the Microsoft Nokia 230 was created as a selfie phone, which makes no sense, to put it mildly. Both cameras offer low quality, and by the fact that this device is not suitable for social media, the photos taken are more likely to just get stuck in it. Unless one is deliberately looking for low quality, and then wants to use them as a strange form of art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The size of the phone is also surprising, as it is quite large, yet slim. Most S30+ cell phones are rather small and chunky monstrosities with barely legible displays.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's also worth mentioning that as a device released in 2015, it accepts mini size SIM cards, not micro or nano. I guess in every way this phone tries to mimic the cheapest models from 2005.
