		<h1>Microsoft Lumia&nbsp;532</h1>
		<p>
			Slightly modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_X2_(2014)">Nokia X2</a> with Windows Phone instead of Android and Microsoft logo on the case.<br>
			The model released together with the twin Lumia 435, which, relative to the 532, has fewer processor cores and an inferior camera. What did the manufacturer have in mind? It's hard to say.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Microsoft Lumia 532/435 is the second smartphone in the Lumia series with the Microsoft logo after the 535. The rebranding came shortly after the company acquired Nokia's mobile division.<br>
			The device is made of high-quality plastic with an interesting two-layer effect, familiar from other Nokia devices such as the Asha 503, although this styling treatment is best known from Apple-branded products released years earlier, such as the <a href="aip55.htm">5th generation iPod</a> or the <a href="aimg5.htm">iMac G5</a>.<br>
			Like the other Lumia generation x3x smartphones, it comes in very striking colors. The green and orange variants are directly reminiscent of highlighters and can be seen from probably the other end of the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			For its price, this smartphone surprises. It runs smoothly, is pleasant to use and offers some capabilities similar to slightly more expensive Lumias. And it's much more powerful and faster than the piece of ...<a href="mml550.htm">something, called Lumia 550</a>, released at the end of the same year.<br>
			It's hard to say anything more about the 532, as it's just a decent device, offering a much better experience than the Android competition of the time. Unless you took advantage of the upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, then any advantages disappeared.
		</p>
		<p>
			An interesting feature is the vibration system. Like old Sony mobiles, such as the <a href="scmdj6.htm">CMD-J6</a> and <a href="scmdj70.htm">CMD-J70</a>, the Lumia 532/435 have no vibration motor, and a speaker that plays low tones is responsible for the shaking. And to make things funnier, it's exactly the same speaker module as in the <a href="nmp1280.htm">Nokia 1280</a>. Someone must have dug deep into the inventory.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, what is wrong with the hardware itself? The display and the camera. The former is not pleasing to the eye due to a visible phenomenon called “backlight bleeding” and poor blacks, and the latter is simply unsatisfactory. Photos, while those taken from a distance are reasonably clear (thanks to the 5 Mpx sensor), up close are impossible due to the lack of autofocus (seriously). Taking a photo of a poster or scanning a document using the Office Lens app? Forget it. One dreads to think what it looks like with the Lumia 435's 2 Mpx camera. The lack of HD 720p video recording capability also says a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interestingly, for some reason, this model in Poland was only available with software from Orange. There was no country variant (CV PL).
