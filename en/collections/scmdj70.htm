		<h1>Sony CMD-J70</h1>
		<p>
			Successor to the <a href="scmdj6.htm">CMD-J6</a> model.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2000 and 2001, Sony launched the J5 and J6 cell phones, which had a retiring, external antenna.<br>
			The J7 and J70 released in 2001, which differed only in the screen bezel and keypad, already had a built-in antenna, and the battery was a separate module. These models hit the market when Sony Ericsson was formed, so it was not surprising to see a warranty card mentioning Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
		</p>
		<p>
			As in previous devices, Sony also used an unusual menu based on a "carousel of balls" with options, a high-resolution display with four shades of gray, distinctive polyphonic ringtones, and a very unusual way of navigating using a "jog dial," which is a dial located on the side, simultaneously serving as an "ok" button when pressed. This dial is made of lower quality plastic than on the J6. Comparing the quality of the materials, the case itself also appears more fragile, as evidenced by the fact that all screw mounts have crumbled. The phone holds on with snaps and word of mouth.
		</p>
		<p>
			As in the J5 and J6, the speaker is designed to cause vibrations when playing very low tones. These, in my opinion, are even weaker than in the predecessor.<br>
			Unlike the J5 and J6, however, the J7/J70 do not have a lock and sound profile change slider, using keyboard shortcuts instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is interesting to note that the J7/J70 models were manufactured exclusively in France.
