		<h1>iPod touch (6th&nbsp;gen.)</h1>
		<p>
			A device of which existence is hard to understand.<br>
			Fifth, sixth and seventh generation iPod touch look like iPhone 5 at first glance, but the lack of a speaker above the screen, the slimmer, rounded shape and the back straightforwardly show that this is not an iPhone. On the outside, the only difference between the fifth and sixth generation is the lack of a lanyard button on the back of the case, but the design is identical.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apparently touch is a representative of the iPod family (and the last series with this iconic logo, produced until 2022), but in fact it is not a dedicated music player. 
			Just such a depleted iPhone 6, where music is just an app.<br>
			And this is where the problem with this device arises. On the one hand it screams that it has iOS, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but on the other hand the battery does not allow it.<br>
			Who is it trying to reach?<br>
			It is not a dedicated player, it lacks dedicated music keys, and the chip responsible for sound processing is the same as in iPhone 5 and 5C. 
			Customers looking for such a device will stay with older iPods or look for something from the competition. I prefer to use a modded <a href="aipm.htm">iPod mini</a> myself.<br>
			Those who want to use wireless headphones and/or music services such as Spotify or Apple Music already have a phone that additionally offers
			much better battery life. What is the point of having a second device that offers even less?<br>
			I will mention that the iPod touch (6th gen) with Wi-Fi and synchronization enabled is not able to withstand 4 days <b>in standby</b>. While in use, the screen on time disappoints.
			<br>
			An additional stupidity is the lack of a percentage indicator of the battery charge level, because "this is how iPods had it". Except this is not an iPod.
