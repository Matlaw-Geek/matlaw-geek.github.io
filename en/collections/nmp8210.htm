		<h1>Nokia 8210</h1>
		<p>
			An extremely small and slim phone, with similar features as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3210">Nokia 3210</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being part of the luxurious 8xxx line, the 8210 offers interchangeable casing, infrared data transfer, convenient controls and, most importantly, distinctive size and lightness.<br>
			These features made it quite a desirable cell phone, and after the release of its successor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8310">8310</a>) it became more accessible through significant discounts in stores and operator offers. Years later, it again gained popularity in less legal areas due to its more difficult locating compared to smartphones and the ease of hiding or smuggling such a small phone. However, it must be admitted that around 2002 this model was already quite ancient, as even the <a href="nmp3410.htm">3410</a> offered a feature-rich system and WAP connectivity. Less favorable reviews reproached the short battery life. Well, with such miniaturization of technology of the late 1990s, there had to be some compromises.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although a purely subjective matter, the Nokia 8210 really captivates with its casing and style. The device is very comfortable to handle both in the hand and in the pocket, and using it is pleasing to the eye. The side phone call volume keys are also a nice addition.
		</p>
		<p>
			For some reason, the case was covered at the factory with a thin, slightly rubbery coating, which lost its color after years. Fortunately, it doesn't turn into a sticky nightmare, and scraping it off and cleaning it isn't that difficult.<br>
			As with many turn-of-the-century Nokia models, the 8210 also suffers from a rubbing bezel paint and problems with the display elastomer, resulting in a fainter or completely disappearing image. In this case, fortunately, by some miracle the LCD looks very good and has no problems. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This unit comes from the Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Polska#Mobile_network">Idea</a> network and had a SIM lock, which was removed using a code calculator.
