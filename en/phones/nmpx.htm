		<h1>Nokia X Dual SIM</h1>
		<p>
			A budget smartphone that is a bit like the bigger and more powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Asha_501">Asha 501</a>, but still weaker and poorer than the <a href="nmpl520.htm">Lumia 520</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The device was created at a strange time when Microsoft was taking over Nokia's mobile division, which was also evident because the X series was quickly slaughtered, just 5 months after the release of that phone and, even more bizarrely, less than a month after the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_X2_(2014)">X2</a> model (not to be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_X2-00">Nokia X2-00</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Nokia X was probably created as a demonstration that “Android devices are terrible, and a true Nokia runs Windows Phone”, as the smartphone's components are of the lowest possible order and far inferior to the similarly priced Lumia 520. One only has to compare the amount of available memory or the camera to see that the Nokia X is some kind of unfunny joke. Although, the <a href="msml532.htm">Lumia 435</a> had an even worse one. Microsoft itself seemed to have lost its way in what it was doing with its newly acquired division.

			What did the X, X+, XL and X2 series of devices even consist of? They were budget Android smartphones with a very heavily redesigned interface that was a cross between that of the Asha series (e.g. 501 or 503) and the Windows Phone tiles. A very strange concept and further limited by the lack of support for Google services, so there was no way to access apps from the Play Store or even... the YouTube app. However, enthusiasts quickly found a way to fix this deliberate impoverishment of the system.<br>The lack of function keys also hurts, as there is only a return button under the screen. Exactly as it is in the aforementioned models of the Asha series. Switching to the home screen is done by holding it down, and switching between applications is possible from the “Fastlane” timeline, accessible by sliding the home screen sideways. Many Android apps at the time still required the use of a context menu, which here opens by sliding out a virtual bar at the bottom of the screen. What the...

			The only thing that can really be praised is the build and the quality of the plastic. The phone fits comfortably in the hand, with the material being really solid and pleasant to the touch.
