		<h1>Nokia 3210</h1>
		<p>
			Quite a chic and desirable phone in its time. Successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5110">5110</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3110">3110</a> models.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time of its release, the Nokia 3210 impressed with its size and built-in antenna, when competitors in a similar segment offered larger and less friendly designs. This cell phone sold better than its successor, the <a href="nmp3310.htm">3310</a>, although years later, through memes and other posts on the Internet, it is the younger model that is remembered more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like its predecessor (the 5110), the 3210 allows you to personalize the look by easily replacing the front and back covers. The panels, called “Xpress-On”, were offered in different colors, designs or even a different keypad. In the gallery to the right you can see the standard gray-black case and an optional, rather extroverted one with an autumn leaf theme.<br>Of course, there was no shortage of unofficial, lower-quality alternatives, so the choice was wider and, if one wanted, one could have a case pretending to be a different model of phone or a more controversial one with cannabis graphics or a picture of a scantily clad woman. The ability to change the case was also important because of the typical problem of Nokia phones with the paint around the screen wearing off or the rear case latches breaking, which, due to the strange design, could very easily be damaged with a fall or reckless disassembly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another option for personalization was the built-in composer, allowing one to create custom ringtones every note. It also allowed users to exchange their own compositions between each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			For some reason, this model does not have vibration, although it was prepared for this function. The inside of the phone has a prepared space for a weighted motor, and the motherboard has two pads that would connect to it. Those who knew about this fact at the time could even put the appropriate component in its place at home, and with the help of a computer, a special serial cable and a program, unlock the vibration function.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interestingly, if you own a unit with an older version of the software (as seen here), you may be surprised by the name of the default, iconic “Nokia tune” ringtone, which, as in older models, is called “Grande valse” here.
